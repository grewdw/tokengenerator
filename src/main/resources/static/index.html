      <img src="icon.png" alt="App Icon" class="icon">
      TabWriter is the tool I wished I had when learning the guitar, and so I built it. It is a
      notebook to scribble chords, tabs, lyrics, and any other song related notes that you
      want.
      <br><br>
      TabWriter is designed to work with Apple Music. Even without a subscription you can create a
      library with any of the millions of songs that Apple Music has to offer. You can write your
      notes for these songs and use it free of charge.
      <br><br>
      With a subscription to Apple Music it is much more powerful. The simple interface allows you
      to playback songs, and also to slow the playback speed.
