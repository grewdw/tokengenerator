      TabWriter is the tool I wished for when learning the guitar and so I built it.
      <br><br>
      It is a scrapbook to scribble chords, tabs, lyrics, and any other song related notes keeping
      them all in one place. Like any fresh notebook it starts empty and ready to go. Start by
      adding any of the millions of songs available on Apple Music to your TabWriter library - you
      donâ€™t even need an Apple Music subscription to do this. Once there you can then create any
      number of pages and start making notes on top of standard templates such as tabs and chord
      boxes.
      <br><br>
      With a subscription to Apple Music, TabWriter becomes much more powerful. It becomes a tool
      for practising and transcribing songs. You can playback any of the songs in your library. Not
      only that but you can control the speed of the song. By slowing the song you can gradually
      build your ability to play a difficult section, or make it easier to transcribe licks and
      solos.
      <br><br>
      TabWriter is currently only available for the iPad and it requires you to have an Apple
      Pencil. In this way it closely resembles the scrapbook that I otherwise used to store my tabs
      and other song notes. I believe the Apple Pencil is the most natural input method for this
      purpose and offers greater freedom of expression than using a keyboard.
